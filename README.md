# bored.ai

This platform was inspired by boredom. Quite literally. Turns out one of the biggest reasons for procastination is getting diverted by things that would quench your boredom. 
And boredom, is not necessarily a bad thing, or is it?

bored.ai is an initiative to help users utilise their free time in things other than the mindless clutches and the drudgery of a mechanized world and style of living. Whether it be solving puzzles, learning a new instrument, planning your routine, journaling your thoughts, or just ruminating about various questions of life, bored.ai is a multifaceted AI-guided platform that tries to convert your boredom into something more, “mindful”.

Now this is not guaranteed to work for everybody. You may just as well leave to never return, but it may work for some, and that’s all that matters.
