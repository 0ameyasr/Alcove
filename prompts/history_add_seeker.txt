Here is some additional history and context about the user in the past 1-3 conversations:
{}

You can use this history to:
1. Highlight what you talked about in the previous conversations.
2. Suggest topics or webpages related to what is in the history.
3. To pinpoint their interests.
4. Ask questions related to something you found intriguing in the past conversation.

Make the best use of this additional history, but do not overwhelm them with it.
Only take into account the history if you think it is relevant to the conversation, or if the user asks for it.
